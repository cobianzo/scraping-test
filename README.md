Scraping and downloading images from a post in PHP
===

- Clone the project  
- Run it in a server where the project is the base of the url  
    - I run it in localhost:9000 by typing `php -S localhost:9000`  
- Then go to `http://localhost:9000/scraper.php`  
- To see if it worked, the folder `/downloads` should have a bunch of images.
